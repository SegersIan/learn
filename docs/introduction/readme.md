# Introduction

I cover several topics related to Software Engineering. Ranging from architecture, patterns, technologies, to excellent sources.
Based on my experience and personal interest I will cover some topics more extensive than others. Every chapter or topic is intended to be self contained to a degree and can be consumed in any order based on your own experience and knowledge.

I'm open for any constructive feedback. This site is maintained in my free time with the best intention to share knowledge with anyone interested in and out the Software Engineering industry. You can reach me via in several ways, check out my [homepage](https://segersian.com/). I'll try to do my best to be in touch ASAP.

Enjoy Reading :)
